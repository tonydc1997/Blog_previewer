#Blog Previewer 
This is a tiny [*jQuery*](https://jquery.com/) project used to create a very simple blog previewer based on the [*jQuery Basics*](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/jquery-basics-2) course on [*Treehouse*](https://teamtreehouse.com/build). Check it out [*here*](https://tonydc1997.github.io/Blog_previewer/).

It has the basic functionality of a blog where you input your title and content, and it previews your input on the right-side of the screen.
